Web Servers - listen for requests respond with data

^
protocol - http - means hyper text traffic protocol, not secure
          - https - is secure

- you should never put your passwords or information into/on a site that
is not secure because anyone can access it


http://myslu.stlawu.edu/~ltorrey/courses/cs332/

      ^
      myslu.stlawu.edu - this is the host - the machine the server runs on


http://myslu.stlawu.edu/~ltorrey/courses/cs332/

                        ^
                        /~ltorrey/courses/cs332/ - this is the path - explains the request

http://myslu.stlawu.edu/~ltorrey/courses/cs332/?x=asdf

                                              ^  suppose we had this at the end...
                                              This is a query string that is there sometimes and is just some extra information
                                              - if we add this onto the end we get to the same place
Host - the machine you run your servers on

- each host has different srvers for different things
- we will have different servers at one point

-to specify the server we want from the host, add :80, where 80 is the port of the server, like an address, put after the host:
                                http://myslu.stlawu.edu:80/~ltorrey/courses/cs332/



HTTP methods:
- GET - send me data
- POST - take this data
- PUT - replace something
- DELETE - delete something
- PATCH - modify something

- GET, POST requests can be made from html links/forms
- PUT, DELETE, PATCH - must be made using javaScript


Request bodies - optional data enclosure, typically sent with post, patch, put requests


Responses: Every request recieves some response....

response codes:

200 -  OK (normal/ success status)

201 - Created (new resource created)

204 - No content - get this when you dont have an icon on tab

304 - not modified

400 - couldnt give you what you wanted (client error), you did something wrong

401 - you are unauthorized, you are not logged in and you need to be to make this request

403 - forbidden - you are trying to do something that you need certain credentials for...
                  you are logged in, you are just not allowed to do this requests

404 - not found - youve seen this when you type the wrong path in a url, the server doesnt have anything in that path for you

418 - I am a teapot - look it up

500 - Internal server error- there is a bug somewhere in the server code, your fault, you need to fix it... you will see these



State -

HTTP is stateless - (requests are independent)

- sometimes you want the server to remember you so that you dont have to put your username/password in everytime you go to a web page

- cookies accomplish this...

Cookie - small piece of data stored by your browser passed along with requests and responses to the associated server - stored by browser


Session - Client specific state stored by the the server linked to a session ID stored in a cookie.
        - Sessions expire when the cookie does
        - or when the Server wants to terminate your session



Routing - (within a web server)  Deciding how requests will be handled based on the request method and path

Rest routes -

GET /resources/ -> retrieve all resources
GET /resources/id -> retrieve all resources with the specific id
DELETE /resources/id -> delete the resource with a specific id
POST /resources/ -> create a new resource
PUT /resourced/id -> replace the resource with a specific id
