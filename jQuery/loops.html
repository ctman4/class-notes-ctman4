<!--
 $('form').on('submit', function(event){// this is some javascrpit that submits the forrm when submit is hit
 //it is a callback function and has some jquery objects wrapped in $

const list -> created a list to hold submits
form.serialize -> how to get form values to show in console when you run it in a browser

could also take a jquery object and find all the elements that match a specification
const inputs = form.find('input');
although this is not an array but a jquery object, we can loop through it
this is a native object, if we want tto do anything fancy with it, turn it into a jquery object by wrapping it with $()
then we can use it with the API that we want because we have a jQuery object -> inout = $(input)

//const li-> here we created the list object using the input
then we append to it,

//then after the loop we use the history div and append the list to it

we then found that when we ran each submit, we would get the history but it would show the history on the page everytime it was submited
// when then added a counter to make it submit number 1, submit number 2, ....

//we also had to delete what was in the text box everythime we wanted to submit another things so we go rid of This
we did this by setting an empty input after


})
